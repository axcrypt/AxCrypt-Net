AxCrypt is file encryption software, developed and maintained by
[AxCrypt AB](https://axcrypt.net). It encrypts files with AES-256 in the
open, documented `.axx` file format, supports password-based and
public-key ("key sharing") encryption, and includes shared .NET libraries
and a cross-platform command-line utility.

**Copyright (C) AxCrypt AB.** Source code licensed under
[GPL-3.0-or-later](LICENSE). "AxCrypt" and the AxCrypt logo are trademarks
of AxCrypt AB — see [TRADEMARK.md](TRADEMARK.md) and [NOTICE](NOTICE).

## Project status

Active development. This repository contains the .NET 10 code base:
the shared encryption core, desktop support libraries, and the `axcrypt`
command-line utility.

## Features

- AES-256 file encryption (AxCrypt V2 format), with AES-128 V1 `.axx`
  backward compatibility for decryption
- Key sharing: encrypt to one or more recipients' RSA public keys
- Compression before encryption
- Integrity protection (HMAC) — tampering is detected
- Cross-platform command-line utility (`axcrypt`) for Windows, macOS, Linux

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `shared/` | Core libraries: crypto core (`AxCrypt.Core`), abstractions, and platform support (`AxCrypt.Mono`, `AxCrypt.Desktop`) |
| `src/AxCrypt.Cli` | Command-line utility (`axcrypt`) |
| `tests/` | NUnit test projects, including CLI round-trip tests |
| `docs/` | CLI reference, code signing documentation |

## Build requirements

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)

The core libraries, CLI, and tests build and run on Windows, macOS, and
Linux. **No AxCrypt AB account, server, or private infrastructure is
required** to build or use the open-source core and CLI.

## How to build

```bash
git clone <this-repository>
cd AxCrypt-Net-App

# Cross-platform: CLI + core + tests
dotnet build src/AxCrypt.Cli/AxCrypt.Cli.csproj -c Release
```

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for details and platform-specific notes.

## How to run

CLI (all platforms):

```bash
dotnet run --project src/AxCrypt.Cli -- help
# or after `dotnet publish`: ./axcrypt help
```

## Command-line quick start

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell), macOS and Linux (bash) — identical syntax:

# Encrypt (prompts for password without echoing it)
axcrypt encrypt --input file.txt --output file.txt.axx

# Decrypt
axcrypt decrypt --input file.txt.axx --output file.txt

# Automation-friendly password input (avoids shell history):
export AXCRYPT_PASSWORD='your-password'      # macOS/Linux
$env:AXCRYPT_PASSWORD = 'your-password'      # Windows PowerShell
axcrypt encrypt --input report.pdf

# Generate an RSA key pair for key sharing
axcrypt keygen --email you@example.com --output ./keys

# Encrypt directly to a recipient's public key
axcrypt encrypt --input file.txt --recipient-public-key ./keys/you@example.com-public.json

# Add a recipient to an existing encrypted file
axcrypt recipients add --file file.txt.axx --public-key recipient-public.json

# Inspect an encrypted file (name, timestamps, recipients)
axcrypt show --input file.txt.axx

axcrypt version
axcrypt help
```

## Security model

- Files are encrypted with AES (256-bit in the V2 format) using keys
  derived from your password (PBKDF2/NIST key wrap with calibrated
  iterations) and/or wrapped with recipients' RSA public keys.
- Integrity is protected with an HMAC; tampering and corruption are
  detected on decryption.
- **Your password is the security boundary.** Anyone with the password (or
  a shared private key) can decrypt; a lost password cannot be recovered.
- The CLI never logs or echoes passwords, keys, or plaintext, and works
  fully offline.
- Cryptographic primitives come from the shared `AxCrypt.Core` code and
  its reviewed dependencies; the CLI contains no crypto implementation of
  its own.
